# 2048

This is a clone of the [2048 game](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048), created to demonstrate the [2048 AIs](https://github.com/qpwoeirut/2048-solver) that I've written.

See it in action [here](https://qpwoeirut.github.io/2048/)!

For more information on the strategies, see this [repository](https://github.com/qpwoeirut/2048-solver).


## Notes
[model.bmp](/model.bmp) is actually a binary data file.
It has a .bmp extension so that GitHub pages will compress it while serving it.
